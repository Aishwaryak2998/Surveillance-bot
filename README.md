# Surveillance-bot
When you start out on your engineering journey, you often feel that the materials you learn in college are insufficient. But that is not necessarily true. While the stuff we learn might not make us the new Google, it does provide us with a foundation to build our empire.

We have frequently studied dc motors, operating systems, sensors, different modules, etc. One hurdle in the life of an engineer is to convert theoretical knowledge into practical one. There is no other way to do so except to get down and get your hands dirty.

In this blog, we have created a basic surveillance bot using 6 dc motors and a picam. This project will help us understand the working of basic components and how they can be incorporated into a project that can later be developed into something bigger.
